# 1024

## Overview

This is part of my game clone series, where I take a game and recreate it in Unity, challenging myself to write all the code and create all the graphical assets (except fonts) from scratch.

This is a clone of the popular 2048 game.  
I named the repo "1024" to mark that it spoof version of 2048 but I recently learned that the developer of 2048 said he made a clone of [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Misho.game1024) game, so I guess it's clones all the way down ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
